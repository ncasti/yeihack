# MentorNH

*This a project that was put together by Zach Young, Tom Bu, Jenny Allen, Matt Cohen and Natalia Castillejo Arias.* 

Our aim was to create a service that could bring together college students and New Haven young professionals. We thought this could be a cool resource for students to see all of the cool professional opportunities that exist in fields of interest.
